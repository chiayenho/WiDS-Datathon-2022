# WiDS-Datathon-2022
I attended the WiDS Datathon 2022 competition, which is the first machine learning competition I joinned.

The main goal is to predict building energy consumption by analyzing differences in building energy efficiency. 

For data exploration part:

I created some plots to better understand the data distribution and correlation. Futher, I created some new features based on my understanding.

For model building part:

First, I built linear regression and decision tree as the baseline model.
Then, I tried ensembling models such as XGBoost, LightGBM, and Catboost. 
However, due to computing limitation of my laptop, I was not able to conduct a more comprehensive gridsearch. 
Besides, I plotted the feature importance to see which feature played important part.
